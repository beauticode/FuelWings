As of January 24, 2025: 
I am revoking the "All Rights Reserved" licensing on this mod ("FuelWings"), as I no longer intend to support the mod.
I have agreed for LinuxGuruGamer to take over the mod and update/modify as will, with free redistribution priviledges, for any purpose, as long as there maintains some sort of credit/mention to the original author of the mod (myself).

V/r,
-Gary ("DIYGary") Smith, aka "Tortoise" on the KSP forums.
